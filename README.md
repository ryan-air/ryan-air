Hi everyone! I'm Ryan, a high school student with an extreme passion for computer science, especially anything related to machine and deep learning. Whilst I have not taken up computer science as a subject in high school, I am more than motivated and committed to learning and growing outside school and hope to contribute to this community as much as possible.
